# SQL-project-ENGETO

## Data about salaries and food prices and their processing using SQL.

Project assignment: <br>
Please prepare a comprehensive data documentation that shows comparisons of food product availability based on average incomes over a specific period of time. <br>

As additional data, prepare a table with GDP, GINI coefficient and population of other European countries in the same period, as a primary overview for the Czech Republic.


### Research questions: <br>
Question 1: Are wages rising in all industries over the years, or falling in some? <br>
Question 2: How many liters of milk and kilograms of bread can be bought in the first and last comparable periods in the available price and wage data? <br>
Question 3: Which food category is increasing in price the slowest (has the lowest percentage year-on-year increase)? <br>
Question 4: Has there been a year in which the year-on-year increase in food prices was significantly higher than wage growth (greater than 10%)? <br>
Question 5: Does the level of GDP affect changes in wages and food prices? Or, if the GDP increases more significantly in one year, will this be reflected in food prices or wages in the same or the following year by a more significant increase? <br>
